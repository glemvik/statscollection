> Clean code, high-quality documentation and clear contribution guidelines will attract proficient developers.
  
Statscollection aims to be extremely *accessible to contributors*.
Every meaningful contribution is welcome, this includes

- **Documentation fixes** - spellchecking, rewriting, clarifying, extending, etc.
- **Code reviews** - reviewing existing code, rewriting functions, improving algorithms, etc.
- **Code contributions** - extending sub-packages or *creating your own sub-package*.

Contributors may list their GitHub usernames or full names in the contributors section in the documentation.
High-quality contributions will give membership to the [statscollection-dev](https://github.com/statscollection-dev)` GitHub organization.
